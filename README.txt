	For this assignment, I extensively researched both resume content and layout in the realms of both print and web. Initially, I struggled with diverging away from making my resume look like a rudimentary list with bullet points. However, as I began to feel more comfortable with what I learned in class and on Codeacademy, this reflected in the elevated complexity of my coding. The bulleted list vanished and was thus replaced with elegant spacing and subtle box separations. Along with this, I incorporated design principles, such as hierarchy and white space, into my resume.
        Once flexBox was covered in class, I immediately applied that tool to my project. From there, it was infinitely much easier to visualize my resume points. This was my first attempt at using flexBox so I looked into various ways to work within it. My aim was to create a responsive design that emphasized my credentials and skills. Beyond that, I also desired a design to highlight my interest in patterns. Therefore, through the use of a clean, minimalist, modern-esque resume layout, I believe I was able to achieve that. I even created a pattern to fit within the boxes, tying in the accent color as well. As aforementioned, for a while I battled the list-like resume layout, but upon learning and discovering new tags in class, I was able to steer away from that. I paired the beautiful, legible font that is Georgia with the smooth sans-serif Raleway (a free Google font). After some research, I learned that Georgia is a common web font since it was originally designed by Matthew Carter for web use; it is easy to read, and it is highly capable of working on smaller screens, such as a phone.
